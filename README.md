Overview

The AI for Early Disease Detection System leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect diseases at their early stages. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing accurate and timely predictions using medical data or imaging.

Use Cases:

Identifying early symptoms of chronic diseases.

Detecting abnormalities in medical images (e.g., X-rays, CT scans).

Assisting in predictive healthcare analytics.



---

Features

High Accuracy Models: Trained on diverse datasets for precise predictions.

Multi-Disease Support: Supports detection of multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions.

Interactive UI: User-friendly interface for healthcare providers to input data and view results.

Real-Time Analysis: Swift processing of data for immediate feedback.



---

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript

Frameworks/Libraries:

Frontend: React.js/Angular

Backend: Flask/Django

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn


Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL

Cloud Services: AWS/GCP (optional for deployment)

Tools: Docker, Kubernetes (for containerization and orchestration)

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Node.js (if using a JavaScript-based frontend)

Virtual environment tools (e.g., venv or conda)


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/early-disease-detection-system.git  
cd early-disease-detection-system


2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Start the backend server:

python app.py


4. Navigate to the frontend directory (if applicable) and install dependencies:

cd frontend  
npm install  
npm start
